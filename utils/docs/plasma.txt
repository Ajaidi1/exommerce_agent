Plasma: Comprehensive Intelligence Platform for Enterprises, Startups, and Industries

Overview

Plasma is an advanced intelligence platform designed to empower organizations—including enterprises, industries, and startups—to harness real-time data, optimize operations, and scale efficiently. The platform is built with modularity, flexibility, and scalability at its core, enabling organizations to manage complex digital ecosystems, make data-driven decisions, and maintain a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic environment.
Core Architectural Concepts: Oriented Around Real-Time Intelligence

Plasma’s architecture is centered on delivering real-time intelligence. The platform’s design ensures that every component contributes to its ability to process, analyze, and act on data in real time, allowing organizations to respond swiftly and effectively to changing conditions.
Key Components

Plasma is composed of various components, each fulfilling a specific role within the platform. These components are grouped based on their functions within the platform’s architecture.
1. Definition

    Entity: An Entity in Plasma represents a fundamental object, process, or concept within the platform’s domain. It captures the key elements and attributes of the world in which the platform operates, serving as a core building block of the platform's data model. Entities are used to define the essential components and relationships that the platform manages and interacts with.
    Metric: A Metric in Plasma is a measurable data point that quantifies aspects of the platform’s domain, providing insights into the state of the world it operates in. Metrics can be internal or external and are essential for monitoring, analyzing, stabilizing, and understanding the dynamic conditions within the platform's realm.

2. Orchestration

    Application: An Application in Plasma is responsible for orchestrating Services to fulfill specific operational tasks within the platform. It integrates these Services to carry out its responsibilities, processing inputs and signals from the platform's environment. Through this orchestration, the Application interacts with and produces Entities and Metrics that reflect the platform’s state and operations.
    Flow: A Flow in Plasma defines the logic and sequence of operations by specifying when and how a Skill should be triggered. This can be based on an event, a schedule, or other signals within the platform. A Flow determines the conditions under which a Skill is executed and directs where the output of that Skill should be delivered, ensuring that the right processes are executed at the right time.

3. Configuration

    Service: A Service in Plasma configures the Software to meet the specific needs of an Application. By defining the necessary settings and parameters, a Service allows the same Software to be reused across different Applications, ensuring consistency and efficiency. This approach maximizes reusability and enables centralized monitoring, so that updates—such as those addressing security vulnerabilities—can be applied universally, ensuring that all Applications using the Software benefit from the update.
    Skill: A Skill in Plasma configures a specific Function to be executed within a Flow, similar to how a Service configures Software for an Application. It prepares the Function to respond to the triggers defined in the Flow, ensuring that the process executes correctly and efficiently. This setup allows the Function to be reused across different Flows, enabling consistent behavior and efficient management within the platform.

4. Computation

    Software: Software in Plasma is responsible for performing core computational tasks within the platform, driving data processing, automation, and analysis.
    Function: A Function in Plasma is a basic unit of computation that operates within Flows. It is set up by a Skill and triggered by a Flow to perform specific tasks. Functions allow for focused, efficient processing within the platform, ensuring that operations are carried out smoothly and effectively.

5. Abstraction

    Library: A Library in Plasma is a collection of reusable tools or utilities that help maintain the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle across Functions and Software. By providing pre-built, modular components, Libraries allow developers to streamline development and configuration, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy within the platform.

6. Allocation

    Chassis: The Chassis in Plasma is the structural framework within the Model, responsible for allocating and connecting components to ensure seamless communication and operation across the platform.

7. Composition and Distribution

    Package: A Package in Plasma is a collection of related components—primarily Applications and Flows—grouped together for easy deployment, management, and reusability. Packages are designed to encapsulate and compose functionalities around specific themes or domains, such as "Learn," "Business," or "Energy." This composability enables organizations to easily integrate and reuse these components across different projects or environments, ensuring efficient and consistent implementation of key platform features.
    Model: A Model in Plasma is a foundational blueprint that defines how components, primarily Applications and Flows, are attached to the Chassis. The Model serves as a central place for organizing and connecting these elements, enabling the creation of tailored Platforms that can be instantiated and adapted as needed.

8. Instantiation and Execution

    Platform: The Platform in Plasma is an operational instance of a Model, integrating all the components defined within that Model. The Platform runs on Nodes, managing and optimizing business operations in real time.
    Node: A Node in Plasma is a physical or virtual environment where the Platform operates. Nodes provide the computational resources necessary for executing tasks, running applications, and processing data within the platform.

Component Metadata

Each component within Plasma is described using specific metadata attributes that help in identifying and managing the components within the platform. These include:

    Platform Component Name (PCN): The unique name assigned to each component within the platform.
    Platform Component Short Name (PCSN): A shorter version of the component name, often used in configurations and code.
    Platform Component Kind (PCK): The type or category of the component (e.g., Service, Application, Function).
    Platform Component Layer (PCL): The Plasma Layer under which the component is registered, aligning with the platform’s structural layers such as Foundation, Interaction, Cognition, etc.
    Platform Component Channel (PCC): Defines the communication channels or interfaces the component uses.
    Platform Component Location (PCLN): The physical or virtual location where the component resides or operates.
    Platform Component Tags (PCT): Tags or labels assigned to the component for easier identification and categorization.
    Platform Component Version (PCV): The version of the component, indicating its iteration or release stage.
    Platform Component Image (PCI): The visual or binary representation associated with the component, often used for containerized components.

Platform Layers

Plasma’s operations are organized into six distinct layers, each contributing to the platform's real-time intelligence capabilities:

    Foundation Layer: Provides the essential infrastructure—such as servers, networks, and storage—that supports the platform’s operations, ensuring a stable and scalable base.
    Integration Layer: Manages data flow and connectivity between components and external systems, ensuring seamless communication and operation across the platform.
